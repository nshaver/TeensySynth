These files will make new waveforms available for use via the Teensy Audio libraries. You will have to update files that are installed as part of the Teensyduino installation.

copy/replace all files from this directory to the Audio directory, like here:
arduino-1.8.9/hardware/teensy/avr/libraries/Audio/
